Working on relearning VB.Net programming again since first learning it in the early 2000's. This is a simple program counts up to a user specified value in either odd or even increments. It is the project from "Practice For Next Loops & If Blocks" video by Kevin Drumm that was reposted
on the freeCodeCamp page on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFWQdGn5DaU&list=WL&index=4&t=7697s).

I added more validation functionality in my program compared to Kevin by utilizing several Do-While loops and using a Try-Catch block to account for the user entering a value greater than the max value for an integer.  I also added some basic code to allow users to exit out by entering cancel.
